# Nashville Housing Data Cleaning Project 🏡

## 📌 About the Project
This project involves **cleaning and transforming** the Nashville Housing dataset using **SQL**.  
The goal is to:
- ✅ Ensure **data consistency**  
- ✅ **Remove duplicates**  
- ✅ **Standardize formats** for better analysis  

The queries in this project are designed to clean **messy real-world data** and make it **ready for analysis**.

---

## 📂 Dataset: `NashvilleHousing`
The dataset contains **real estate transactions** in Nashville, TN.

## 🛠️ SQL Data Cleaning Steps

### 1. Standardize Date Format
```sql
-- Standardize Date Format (Remove '00:00:00:0000')
Select SaleDate, Convert(Date, SaleDate)
from PortfolioProject..NashvilleHousing

Update PortfolioProject..NashvilleHousing
SET SaleDate = Convert(Date, SaleDate)
```
**Explanation:** Converts the SaleDate field to a standard date format by removing the time component.

### 2. Populate Missing Property Addresses
```sql
-- Populate empty Property Address data based on equal ParcelID
select * from PortfolioProject..NashvilleHousing 
where PropertyAddress is null    --  After updating nothing will show

select a.ParcelID, a.PropertyAddress, b.ParcelID, b.PropertyAddress, ISNULL(a.PropertyAddress, b.PropertyAddress)
from PortfolioProject..NashvilleHousing a JOIN PortfolioProject..NashvilleHousing b
on a.ParcelID = b.ParcelID
and a.UniqueID <> b.UniqueID
where a.PropertyAddress is null

update a SET PropertyAddress = ISNULL(a.PropertyAddress, b.PropertyAddress)
from PortfolioProject..NashvilleHousing a JOIN PortfolioProject..NashvilleHousing b
on a.ParcelID = b.ParcelID
and a.UniqueID <> b.UniqueID
where a.PropertyAddress is null
```
**Explanation:** Identifies records with missing addresses and fills them by matching records with the same ParcelID, since properties with identical ParcelIDs should have the same address.

### 3. Break Out Property Address into Individual Columns
```sql
-- Breaking out PropertyAddress into individual columns (Address, City) using Substring
select 
Substring(PropertyAddress, 1, CHARINDEX(',', PropertyAddress) -1) as Address,
Substring(PropertyAddress, CHARINDEX(',', PropertyAddress)+1, LEN(PropertyAddress)) as City
from PortfolioProject..NashvilleHousing 

ALTER TABLE PortfolioProject..NashvilleHousing 
Add PropertySplitAddress Nvarchar(255);

Update PortfolioProject..NashvilleHousing 
Set PropertySplitAddress = Substring(PropertyAddress, 1, CHARINDEX(',', PropertyAddress) -1) 

ALTER TABLE PortfolioProject..NashvilleHousing 
Add PropertySplitCity Nvarchar(255);

Update PortfolioProject..NashvilleHousing 
SET PropertySplitCity = Substring(PropertyAddress, CHARINDEX(',', PropertyAddress)+1, LEN(PropertyAddress)) 
```
**Explanation:** Splits the PropertyAddress field into separate address and city columns using SUBSTRING and CHARINDEX functions, creating a more structured format for analysis.

### 4. Break Out Owner Address into Individual Columns
```sql
-- Breaking out OwnerAddress into individual columns (Address, City, State) using Parsename
Select OwnerAddress From PortfolioProject..NashvilleHousing

-- Parsename separates each '.'
-- Replacing ',' with dots:
select 
PARSENAME(REPLACE(OwnerAddress, ',', '.'), 3),
PARSENAME(REPLACE(OwnerAddress, ',', '.'), 2),
PARSENAME(REPLACE(OwnerAddress, ',', '.'), 1)
From PortfolioProject..NashvilleHousing;

ALTER TABLE PortfolioProject..NashvilleHousing 
Add OwnerSplitAddress Nvarchar(255);

Update PortfolioProject..NashvilleHousing 
Set OwnerSplitAddress = PARSENAME(REPLACE(OwnerAddress, ',', '.'), 3);

ALTER TABLE PortfolioProject..NashvilleHousing 
Add OwnerSplitCity Nvarchar(255);

Update PortfolioProject..NashvilleHousing 
SET OwnerSplitCity = PARSENAME(REPLACE(OwnerAddress, ',', '.'), 2);

ALTER TABLE PortfolioProject..NashvilleHousing 
Add OwnerSplitState Nvarchar(255);

Update PortfolioProject..NashvilleHousing 
SET OwnerSplitState = PARSENAME(REPLACE(OwnerAddress, ',', '.'), 1);
```
**Explanation:** Uses the PARSENAME function (after replacing commas with periods) to separate the OwnerAddress field into address, city, and state columns for better data organization.

### 5. Standardize Values in SoldAsVacant Field
```sql
-- Change Y and N to "Yes" and "No" in SoldAsVacant field 
Update PortfolioProject..NashvilleHousing 
Set SoldAsVacant =
	CASE When CAST(SoldAsVacant as VARCHAR(MAX)) = 'Y' THEN 'Yes'
		 When CAST(SoldAsVacant as VARCHAR(MAX)) = 'N' THEN 'No'
		 ELSE CAST(SoldAsVacant as VARCHAR(MAX))
		 End

-- Check results:
SELECT DISTINCT CAST(SoldAsVacant AS VARCHAR(MAX)), count(CAST(SoldAsVacant AS VARCHAR(MAX)))
FROM PortfolioProject..NashvilleHousing
Group by CAST(SoldAsVacant AS VARCHAR(MAX))
```
**Explanation:** Standardizes the SoldAsVacant field by converting 'Y' and 'N' values to 'Yes' and 'No' using CASE statements, ensuring consistency in categorical data.

### 6. Remove Duplicate Records
```sql
-- Remove Duplicates
WITH RowNumCTE AS (
    SELECT *,
        ROW_NUMBER() OVER(
            PARTITION BY ParcelID, PropertyAddress, SalePrice, SaleDate, LegalReference
            ORDER BY UniqueID
        ) AS row_num
    FROM PortfolioProject..NashvilleHousing
)
Delete FROM RowNumCTE
where row_num > 1
```
**Explanation:** Uses a Common Table Expression (CTE) with the ROW_NUMBER() window function to identify and remove duplicate records based on key fields, ensuring data integrity.

### 7. Delete Unused Columns
```sql
-- Delete unused columns
Select * From PortfolioProject..NashvilleHousing

Alter Table PortfolioProject..NashvilleHousing
Drop Column OwnerAddress, TaxDistrict, PropertyAddress

Alter Table PortfolioProject..NashvilleHousing
Drop Column SaleDate
```
**Explanation:** Removes the original columns that are no longer needed after creating more structured versions, optimizing the table schema.
